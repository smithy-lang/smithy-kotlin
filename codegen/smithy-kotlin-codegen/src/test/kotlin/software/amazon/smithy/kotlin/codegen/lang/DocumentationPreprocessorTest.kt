request.</p>

<p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p>

<p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the
upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle
configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort
action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting

<p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and
Permissions</a>.</p>

<p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate
a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the
multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special
about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>.</p>

<note>
<p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being
charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart
upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for
storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p>
</note>

<p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3
encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you
access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide
your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to
initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p>
<p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must
have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>
actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data
from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions">Multipart upload API
and permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

<p>If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account
as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM
user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the
permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p>

Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p>

<dt>Access Permissions</dt>
<dd>
<p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that
should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to
grant the permissions using the request headers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For
more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the
<code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,
<code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and
<code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to
the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information,
see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL)

<p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side
encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts
your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you
access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed
encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored
in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys
used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code>

</ul>
<note>
<p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but
don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>,
Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.</p>
</note>
<important>
<p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if
you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p>

see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own
encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm</code>
</p>

<dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt>

<p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this
operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access
control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added
to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. With this
operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of
predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL
has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned
ACL</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access
permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers.
Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For
more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access
Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of
grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly,
use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-read</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-write</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
of an Amazon Web Services account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined
group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email
address of an Amazon Web Services account</p>
<note>
<p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>US East (N. Virginia)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>US West (N. California)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> US West (Oregon)</p>

</note>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p>
<p>
<code>x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" </code>

   + `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
   + `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`
If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.For more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
+ Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.
   + `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
   + `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
   + `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

## Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers
You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html). With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:
+ Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
+ Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html). In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:
   + `x-amz-grant-read`
   + `x-amz-grant-write`
   + `x-amz-grant-read-acp`
   + `x-amz-grant-write-acp`
   + `x-amz-grant-full-control`
You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
   + `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account
   + `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
   + `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services accountUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: 
      + US East (N. Virginia)
      + US West (N. California)
      +  US West (Oregon)
      +  Asia Pacific (Singapore)
      + Asia Pacific (Sydney)
      + Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
      + Europe (Ireland)
      + South America (São Paulo)
For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:`x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `
