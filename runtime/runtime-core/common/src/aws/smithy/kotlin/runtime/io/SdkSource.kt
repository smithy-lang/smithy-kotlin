/**
 * A source for reading a stream of bytes (e.g. from file, network, or in-memory buffer). Sources may
 * be layered to transform data as it is read (e.g. to decompress, decrypt, or remove protocol framing).
 *
 * Most application code should not operate on a source directly, but rather a [SdkBufferedSource] which is
 * more convenient. Use [SdkSource.buffer] to wrap any source with a buffer.
 *
 * ### Thread/Coroutine Safety
 *
 * Sources are not thread safe by default. Do not share a source between threads or coroutines without external
 * synchronization.
 *
 * This is a blocking interface! Use from coroutines should be done from an appropriate dispatcher
 * (e.g. `Dispatchers.IO`).
